counter0 : setState sends current state to javascript.
counter1 : this.state.count to oldState.count for secuthyrity reason (race condition)

=== : strict equality

const list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; # 1~5
const copy = [...list1, 6]; # 1~6

list1.splice(3, 1) # remove elements starting with index 3, pull out 1 element.

tasks1 : when using setState, if you dont need any functions(just changing values), this.setState(state=>({})) would be okay
         else, when you need to loop, condition or anything else, you should return state values.
